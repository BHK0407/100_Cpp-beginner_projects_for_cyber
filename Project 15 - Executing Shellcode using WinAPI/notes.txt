Methodology:

- VirtualAlloc(): Used for allocating memory in the process.

- RtlMoveMemory(): Copies a specific memory block to a destination memory block (Will be used for moving shellcode to the allocated memory buffer in the program later).

- CreateThread(): Creates a thread and executes certain piece of code (Will be used to create a thread in our program to execute the shellcode).
