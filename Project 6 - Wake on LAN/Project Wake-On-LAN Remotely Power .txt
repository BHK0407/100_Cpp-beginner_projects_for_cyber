Project Wake-On-LAN: Remotely Power ON a PC over the internet using the Wake-on-LAN protocol

Wake-on-LAN (“WOL”) is implemented using a specially designed packet called a magic packet, which is sent to all computers in a network, among them the computer to be awakened.
The magic packet contains the MAC address of the destination computer, an identifying number built into each network interface card (“NIC”) or other ethernet devices in a computer, that enables it to be uniquely recognized and addressed on a network.
Powered-down or turned-off computers capable of Wake-on-LAN will contain network devices able to “listen” to incoming packets in low-power mode while the system is powered down.
If a magic packet is received that is directed to the device’s MAC address, the NIC signals the computer’s power supply or motherboard to initiate system wake-up, much in the same way as pressing the power button would do.
The magic packet is sent on the data link layer (layer 2 in the OSI model) and when sent, is broadcast to all attached devices on a given network, using the network broadcast address; the IP-address (layer 3 in the OSI model) is not used.
